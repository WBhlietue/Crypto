I am the bone of my sword,
Steel is my body and fire is my blood
I have created over a thousand blades
Unknown to death nor known to life
Have withstood pain to create many weapons 
Yet, those hands will never hold anything
So as I pray
Unlimited Blade Works

What you need is my Stand "The World"
What you can find beyond the powers of my Stand is where you need to go in order to find Heaven. 
What you need is a trustworthy friend. 
He must be someone capable of controlling his own desires. 
He must be someone who is not interested in political power, fame, wealth, or sexual desire, and who chooses the will of God before the law of humans
Will I, DIO, be able to meet someone like this one day?
What I also need is the lives of more than 36 humans who have sinned, because those who have sinned harbor a strong power within.

There are 14 phrases that one must keep in mind:
    Spiral staircase
    Rhinoceros beetleW
    Desolation RowW
    Fig tart
    Rhinoceros beetle
    Via Dolorosa
    Rhinoceros beetle
    Singularity point
    Giotto
    Angel
    Hydrangea
    Rhinoceros beetle
    Singularity point
    Secret emperor

I'll engrave these words onto my Stand so I won't forget them. 
What is most necessary is "courage". 
I must have the courage to destroy my Stand momentarily. 
As it disintegrates, my Stand will absorb the souls of the 36 sinners and will give birth to something utterly new.

Whatever is born will "awaken". 
It will show interest in the 14 phrases that my trusted friend will utter... 
My friend will trust me and I will become his "friend".

Lastly, I need an appropriate location. 
North latitude, 28 degrees, 24 minutes, West longitude 80 degrees, 36 minutes...

Go there and wait for the New Moon...

That's when Heaven will come.
